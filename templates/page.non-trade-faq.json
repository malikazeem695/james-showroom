However, we have worked with many of our lines to offer rings sets of the entire collection, or segments of the collection, for a reasonable fee.  JAMES will apply a credit for the cost of the ring set on your first order of 10 yards or more for that respective line.  Please contact the showrooms for pricing.<\/p>"
